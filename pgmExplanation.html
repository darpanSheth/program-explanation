<h1>Age category programe explanation</h1>
<hr>
<p> 
    <strong><u> Explanation for the Javacript code fragment given below :-</u></strong><br>
    Basically, this program gives us the category in which a person fall on the basis of their age. 
    Firstly, It defines a variable <var>checkAgeCategory</var> and asks the user for some input.<br>
    Than, it converts the String to a Number using numberFormat since the user input from prompt window 
    is always in the form of <abbr title="Group of zero or more characters enclosed in &quot;&quot;">"String"</abbr><br>
    Based on user's input, it will give the output defining the person's category by using 
    <dfn>if, else-if, else</dfn> conditional statements that varies output for different conditions.<br><br>
    If the <var>checkAgeCategory</var> is  <kbd>(&le;12)</kbd>, output will be <samp>"You are still a child!"</samp><br>
    If the <var>checkAgeCategory</var> is  <kbd>(&gt;12 & &le;19)</kbd>, output will be <samp>"You are a teenager!"</samp><br>
    If the <var>checkAgeCategory</var> is  <kbd>(&gt;19 & &lt;60)</kbd>, output will be <samp>"You are an adult!"</samp><br>
    If the <var>checkAgeCategory</var> is  <kbd>(&ge;60)</kbd>, output will be <samp>"You are a senior adult!"</samp>
</p>
<h4><u>Javascript code :</u></h4>
<pre><code>
    let checkAgeCategory = prompt("Please enter you age");   //Prompts user for the age input
    checkAgeCategory = Number(checkAgeCategory);             //Converts String input to a Number
    
    if(checkAgeCategory >= 60){
        alert("You are a senior adult");
    }
    else if(checkAgeCategory > 19){
        alert("You are an adult!");
    }
    else if(checkAgeCategory > 12){
        alert("You are a teenager");
    }
    else{
        alert("You are still a child!");
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    <span><b>Please note:</b></span> <mark><i>While using if, else-if statements, the programe will terminate if the first condition is true.</i></mark><br>
    That is why we have checked the <ins>higher age condition</ins> first in our code and not the <del>lower age condition</del>. <br><br>
    For instance- If we checked the (checkAgeCategory > 12) condition first, output for teenager would only be displayed.<br>
    And our programe will not take the fact into consideration that this person could also be an adult or a senior adult.<br>
    So, sometimes the programming logic seems to be simple but it is not often as easy as it seems.<br><br>
    This reminds me of a great saying by a great programmer which is stated as follows-:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.overallmotivation.com/quotes/programming-quotes/">
    <q>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if youâ€™re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?</q>
